2015.11.13 notes:

Bad crash, not sure why. Too many VMs & Firefox sessions, perhaps. Shut down all pipelines & rebooted server. Next time: install iTOP with more capacity (Vagrant config). Would be nice to have some VMs & monitoring going. Ideal: Nagios/iTOP integration.

Comment from class: Describe a more typical ITIL flow - incident, problem, change...

2016 spring notes:
installed as enterprise, not service provider, production not test (recalling that the test data caused confusion)
updated pies.sh obvious error but did not re-run it.
