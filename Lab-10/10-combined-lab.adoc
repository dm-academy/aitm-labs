= Lab 10: Security, and Governance, Risk, and Compliance

FALL 2016 notes: fixing banner is not a good place to start. it doesn't show up for students ssh'ing in.

== Objectives

In this lab, you will gain some hands on experience in vulnerability scanning and remediation.

Objectives:

* Understand a "vulnerability" and how it can be detected
* Understand how a vulnerability may be fixed or remediated

== Overview

Working individually, you will run an "inside-out" vulnerability scan and a simple "outside-in" penetration scan on a virtual machine.  The testing will be performed by downloading two vulnerability scanners and running them on your servers.

You will research the results and recommend at least one fix that can be implemented in the Vagrantfile and associated cookbook and/or shell script for building the server.

You will fix at least two vulnerabilities and participate in group and class discussion about how this relates to the broader topics of governance, risk, and compliance.


=== Getting started

Go to your home directory.

 cd

You should still have a vagrant directory. Go:

 cd vagrant
 vagrant up

If this doesn't work, go back to https://github.com/dm-academy/aitm-labs/blob/master/Lab-02/02-tech-lab.adoc[Lab 2] and follow the Section 1 instructions just up through getting the simple Vagrant machine running (do not continue to section 2 in that lab.)

Now, start by logging into your personal server. You should be in `/home/vagrant`. Install Lynis. The overall instructions are here:

https://cisofy.com/documentation/lynis/get-started

You should download using the git approach.

NOTE: If you choose to clone into /usr/local, you will need to sudo.

This scan is run internally on the server, as a script or application that reviews the server's configuration in painstaking detail. It will generate hundreds of findings. You should pick one or two and research them and figure out if there is an easy fix.

Start by logging into your personal server. You should be in `/home/vagrant` or `/home/ubuntu`.

Go to:

https://cisofy.com/documentation/lynis/get-started/#first-run and run the scan.

Be sure to run lynis with the syntax `sudo ./lynis audit system`, because it is not in your path. Sudo gives you more results.

You should be able to run the first scan as the lynis directions suggest. This scan is run internally on the server, as a script or application that reviews the server's configuration in painstaking detail. Lots of output that looks like:

....
- Checking for old files in /tmp                            [ OK ]
 - Checking /tmp sticky bit                                  [ OK ]
 - Mount options of /                                        [ OK ]
 - Checking Locate database                                  [ FOUND ]
.
.
.

 * Consider hardening SSH configuration [SSH-7408]
    - Details  : AllowAgentForwarding (YES --> NO)
      https://cisofy.com/controls/SSH-7408/

  * Configure minimum password age in /etc/login.defs [AUTH-9286]
      https://cisofy.com/controls/AUTH-9286/

  * Configure maximum password age in /etc/login.defs [AUTH-9286]
      https://cisofy.com/controls/AUTH-9286/
....

Let's fix the minium and maxium password age issue in login.defs.

Open file /etc/login.defs using text editor:
# sudo nano /etc/login.defs

Setup (sample) values as follows:

 PASS_MAX_DAYS 30
 PASS_MIN_DAYS 1
 PASS_WARN_AGE 7

To restart sshd on ubuntu 16, use the command:

 sudo systemctl restart sshd

For earlier versions of Ubuntu, use:

 sudo service ssh restart

Between these two resources you should be able to fix the issue. If you have questions, post them to Slack. When you have fixed the issue, run the scan again and confirm the banner is no longer an issue.

=== System hardening

Now for the hard part. Find another vulnerability you can fix. To use class time most efficiently, you should post the vulnerabilities you are researching to Slack. Don't start on something someone else is doing.

You should take some time and think about and/or research the risk any given vulnerability presents. Remember the CISSP terminology:

image::4.10-security-taxonomy.png[]

We will pause class and discuss interesting cases.

TIP: If you search Google on the Lynis ID, e.g. `AUTH-9286`, you should be taken to the cisofy.com site (or perhaps other resources) which will get you started on resolving it.

NOTE: Do not try to fix the banners issue. It only can be tested by logging directly into the server console (which in the case of a VM doesn't really exist), not via ssh.

Be prepared to share you results, positive or negative. If you fix a vulnerability, be sure to document the steps so they could be scripted.

After you have fixed one more lynis vulnerability, read http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/2015/11/13/did-you-wake-up-to-an-alert-about-the-java-deserialization-vulnerability and discuss with your neighbors. What is the National Vulnerability Database? Be prepared to discuss in class.


== Permanently fixing one or more vulnerabilities (10+ extra credit points).

First, you need to figure out the configuration change required to fix the vulnerability. It should be something that you can script.

* something installed that doesn't need to be
* something that should be there, that isn't
* permissions that need to be tightened down.

* 1 vulnerability fixed: 10 points
* 2 : 15 points
* 3 : 20 points.
* 10 or more: 30 points

In order to gain the extra credit:

* Create a new VM and run the vulnerability scanner.
* Save the output to a text file, named "initial-output.log"
* Run the necessary commands to fix the vulnerability.
* Put them into a shell script.
* Call the shell script from your vagrant file
* Vagrant destroy and vagrant up your machine, confirming that it comes up with the correct fix(es)
* Run the scanner again, saving the output to "final-output.log" and showing that they are fixed

IMPORTANT: Submit the 2 output files, your modified Vagrantfile, and your script for extra credit.



You can script commands like

 apt-get install <some program>

You can't script an interactive text editor (like nano). To change configuration files, sed is your friend. Simple example:

....
char@seis664:~$ echo myScriptContent > test.txt
char@seis664:~$ cat test.txt
myScriptContent
char@seis664:~$ sed -i s/Script/New/g test.txt
char@seis664:~$ cat test.txt
myNewContent
....

You may need to Google "regular expressions."

=== Web vulnerability testing scan
(if time)

When you have reflected enough on the Java deserialization vulnerability and the implications of that article, move on to a Web vulnerability. We will install Java and apache2 on your VM. (Don't try to install these on the main server; you won't be able to.)

First review the first few pages of the https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/releases/download/2.5.0/ZAPGettingStartedGuide-2.5.pdf[zaproxy docs].

ON YOUR VM, go:

....
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y default-jdk apache2

wget https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/releases/download/2.5.0/ZAP_2.5.0_Linux.tar.gz
tar -xvf ZAP_2.5.0_Linux.tar.gz

cd ZAP_2.5.0/
./zap.sh -cmd -quickurl http://localhost:80
....

We run this script externally to the machine being tested, and give it the URL. It then probes the URL and the server, as a form of penetration testing. It will again generate a number of findings. Research them and figure out if there is an easy fix. Share with class on Slack.

NOTE: You will get raw XML dumped to the terminal. You can cut and paste this to an *.xml document on your workstation and open it with a browser for an easier view.

=== Optional ITSM process
Time and instructor lab preparation permitting:

* The vulnerability should be registered as a Problem in iTOP, against the server it is detected on.

* The server rebuild that fixes it will be executed as a Change.

* The Change and the Problem should reference the git pull request ID.

* The Change will then be confirmed as having fixed the Problem, which will then be closed out.

Nessus is often used by security professionals; it is commercial.

OpenVAS is another option, not evaluated.
