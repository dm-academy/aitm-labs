= Lab 02 (Technical) IT Infrastructure


In this lab you will learn about IT infrastructure by running Vagrant and learning basic "infrastructure as code" principles.

This is a long lab, with the following learning objectives:

* Creation of a basic virtual machine using Vagrant
* Using your Linux skills for simple server configuration
* Learning the basics of Git source control
* Combining the three previous skills into an automated "infrastructure as code" use case

==  1. Running Vagrant on the Course Server

Vagrant is already installed on the serverXXX course server, but you need to take a few steps before you can use it.
Assuming you have .ssh configured and have logged in, you should find yourself in your default directory.

IMPORTANT: In the following instructions when you see *YourStudentID*, substitute your user id. Where you see *serverXXX*, substitute the course servername.

Do not type the "$" symbol - this represents the command prompt you see when you log into Linux. It may also be a "#" or have some directory information in front of it, e.g.

	YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$

First, always confirm where you are by issuing the "pwd" (print working directory) command:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ pwd
/home/student/YourStudentID
....

and examine what is in your directory:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ ls -al
drwxr-xr-x  5 YourStudentID student 4096 Sep 19 11:35 .
drwxr-xr-x 32 root  root    4096 Sep 19 09:19 ..
-rw-------  1 YourStudentID student 1040 Sep 19 10:51 .bash_history
drwx------  2 YourStudentID student 4096 Sep 19 09:26 .cache
drwx------  3 YourStudentID student 4096 Sep 18 20:08 .config
drwxr-xr-x  2 YourStudentID student 4096 Sep 19 09:50 .ssh
....

In any command line environment, it is good to run these commands (pwd and ls, or their equivalents) frequently so you maintain awareness of where you are and what might be affected by any commands you run.

Now, make a "vagrant" directory:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ mkdir vagrant
....

Change to your "vagrant" directory:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ cd ~/vagrant
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/vagrant$
....

Type the following command carefully:

	YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/vagrant$ vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64

You should see the following:

	A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
	ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
	the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
	`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.


NOTE: If you install and run Vagrant locally on your own laptop, you won't need to do this next step (editing the Vagrantfile). The VM image will take some time to download.

....
 YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/vagrant$ nano Vagrantfile
....

In the nano text editor, scroll down to the line that says:

 config.vm.box = "xenial64"

and after it, add the line:

 config.vm.box_url = "/var/vagrant/boxes/xenial64.box"

Exit nano, saving the file.

Now, cross your fingers and enter the following command:

	YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/vagrant$ vagrant up

You should see:
....

    default: Guest Additions Version: 4.2.0
    default: VirtualBox Version: 4.3
==> default: Mounting shared folders...
    default: /vagrant => /home/student/YourStudentID/vagrant
....

If you saw the above output, or close to it, try:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/vagrant$ vagrant ssh
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-23-generic x86_64)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/

Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.

Welcome to your Vagrant-built virtual machine.
Last login: Fri Sep 14 06:23:18 2012 from 10.0.2.2
vagrant@xenial64:~$
....

If that worked, congratulations, you did it!

But, what does this all mean?

You now have your own personal Linux machine, operating within the main course server, on which *you are the administrator*. You have tremendous freedom to experiment with its configuration.

If you damage something, you simply need to exit out to the main server command prompt and run "vagrant destroy." This will erase the machine. You can then run "vagrant up" again and the machine will be restored.

IMPORTANT: If you destroy the VM you will LOSE ALL DATA you have on the machine, unless that data is stored in your ~/vagrant directory (https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/index.html[which is mapped] to your /vagrant directory in the VM).

WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT to bridge your VM to the external world. It is not hardened and possibly vulnerable. As long as you do not mess with the network configuration, you will be fine. In a future lab, you will see how to run Firefox on the course server in a X11 window over ssh on your local machine, so you can safely browse to your VM.

For further information, see https://docs.vagrantup.com/.

== 2. Infrastructure configuration

In this part, you will get a very simple introduction to the concept of "infrastructure as code" using shell scripting on your virtual machine in conjunction with Git and Github

**Prerequisites**

Lab 00 & 01: You must have configured ssh and run the Linux tutorial (or be comfortable otherwise with Linux command-line tools).

Lab 02: You must have successfully created your own virtual machine (VM) using Vagrant.

=== Command line operations

You will do the exercises in this part on your new Vagrant VM.

Using the skills you learned in the previous lab (in particular, the mkdir, cd, and touch commands),  perform the following steps:

**Configure a directory structure**

* First, create directories A, C, and D all at the same level

* Directory A should contain sub-directories named B, C and D

* Directory C (the first) should contain directories E and F

* Directory D (the first) should contain directories G, H and I

* Directory H should contain directories J and K

(Yes, there are two C directories. We'll fix this later.)

Every directory should have a file in it, with the letter of the directory doubled in lower case. E.g., directory A should have aa, F would have ff, etc.

TIP: If you get impatient with how labor intensive this is, look around on the man pages for mkdir and touch. Or google something like "mkdir create many directories at once." Perhaps you can create more than one directory or file at once? Perhaps you could do it all in a couple lines??

**Install and use tree**

First, install tree

    vagrant@xenial64~: sudo apt-get install -y tree

NOTE: The "-y" avoids you having to type "yes" to approve the install. It is critical later, as this makes it possible to script the apt-get command.

If you get any kind of access or permissions error, please be sure you are in YOUR vagrant machine, not the main course server (where you do not have permissions to install things.) Re-read the above material carefully.

Use tree to inspect your directory structure. It should look like:

 vagrant@xenial64:~$ tree

 |-- A
|   |-- aa
|   |-- B
|   |   `-- bb
|   |-- C
|   |   `-- cc
|   `-- D
|       `-- dd
|-- C
|   |-- cc
|   |-- E
|   |   `-- ee
|   `-- F
|       `-- ff
|-- D
|   |-- dd
|   |-- G
|   |   `-- gg
|   |-- H
|   |   |-- hh
|   |   |-- J
|   |   |   `-- jj
|   |   `-- K
|   |       `-- kk
|   `-- I
|       `-- ii
`-- postinstall.sh

If you are in PuTTY and getting garbage characters, google "Garbage Characters in PuTTY" and see if you can figure it out.

Now, output the tree to a file. How?

    vagrant@xenial64:~$tree > tree.txt

Review the text file:

    vagrant@xenial64:~$cat tree.txt

Why did I make the directory structure so detailed? This is typical of setting up infrastructure as code - you need to be able to maintain focus and successfully set up instructions that are both complicated and yet repetitive.

IMPORTANT: If you have developed an approach to "mkdir" and "touch" that you wish to refer to later you should copy it to an external text file (outside of your Vagrant VM).

Exit and destroy your VM. The "-f" flag does it immediatley, without further confirmation.

 vagrant@xenial64:~$ exit
 YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/vagrant$ vagrant destroy -f
 ==> default: Forcing shutdown of VM...
 ==> default: Destroying VM and associated drives...

== 3. Working with git

Git is a popular version control system used by software developers and DevOps professionals. One of the key characteristics that sets Git apart from many other version control systems is its distributed nature. Git scales easily from small projects involving a single person all the way up to projects involving a cast of thousands.

We will work with a commercial implementation of the Git platform in this class provided by Github. You can create a free account on Github and host public code repositories, like the one we setup for this lab.

NOTE: Everyone should setup an individual Github account. If you are working in teams, you have the option of either doing the next section individually, or choosing one team member to perform the git forking and cloning tasks.

You will do the exercises in part 2 on the main server, not your VM (which you have now destroyed, right?).

**Set up Github.com & fork the sample repo**

Go to http://github.com and set up a user account (one per individual, even if you are in teams). You probably do NOT want to use your school email account name for this, as your Github account may be an asset throughout your career. *Choose a suitably professional user name.*

NOTE: You will have to keep track of TWO IDs and substitute them at appropriate times:
*YourStudentID* and *YourGithubID*

Skim https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ (it's OK if you don't understand it all immediately - just keep following the steps here)

Go to https://github.com/dm-academy/example and fork the repo. Press the Fork button at top right:

image::fork.jpg[]

Now, go to your home account on Github and find the URL for the forked repository.

Important: you should NOT be copying this:

 https://github.com/dm-academy/example

Instead, it should look like this:

 https://github.com/YourGithubID/example

Go to your home directory:

  YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ cd

Clone the Github repository you forked as "example" to your home directory /home/student/YourID/.

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$:~$ git clone https://github.com/YourGithubID/example
Cloning into 'example'...
remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 0), reused 6 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Checking connectivity... done.

....
Go into it and verify the contents look as below. Notice the username YourGithubID; **this must be replaced with your Github user name**.
....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ cd example/
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ ls
2015-09.adoc  README.md  starter.sh  Vagrantfile
....

**Try git out**

Be sure you are in the new 'example' directory that git created:

    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$
		YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ cd example

Tell git who you are:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ git config --global user.email "you@stthomas.edu"
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ git config --global user.name "your name"
....

Create a file called YourStudentID-testfile, e.g. stud0001-testfile.adoc.

    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ nano your_student_ID-testfile.adoc

(Again, do not put in "YourStudentID" literally. Substitute your student ID. Notice the following examples were done with "YourStudentID" as the student ID.)

Put some http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc] content in it, starting with  the phrase "Hello World."

(Don't worry about Asciidoc formatting unless you want to. Plain text will work just fine.)

Exit nano (ctrl-X, saving as prompted).

Add your file to your git repository

    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ git add YourStudentID-testfile.adoc
    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ git commit -m "my first commit"

You will get:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ git commit -m "my first commit"
[master a60b827] my first commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 YourStudentID-testfile.adoc
....

Now, edit the file again.

 YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ nano YourStudentID-testfile.adoc

Add "Hello Again" as a second line and exit nano in the usual way.

You have now made a change, relative to what you committed. You can see that change through issuing the command "git diff":

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ git diff
diff --git a/YourStudentID-testfile.adoc b/YourStudentID-testfile.adoc

--- a/YourStudentID-testfile.adoc
+++ b/YourStudentID-testfile.adoc
@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@
 Hello World
+Hello Again
....

This clearly shows that Hello Again has been added.

Commit it again (you only need to add it once):
....
 YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ git commit YourStudentID-testfile.adoc -m "second commit"
 [master 0ecb372] second commit
  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
....

Go back into nano and replace "World" with "Mars." Exit nano.

Run git diff again:

....

All of these changes have been locally committed to your git instance. Let's send them back up to your fork at Github. You will need to authenticate (we could set up ssh to github, but not right now):

....

This completes this section. (I am not pulling your work back into the main lab.)

There is much to learn about git and this lab is not intended to be a full tutorial, but rather means to an end, and a quick flavor of the techniques. We will cover further aspects as necessary.

== 4. Automated provisioning and infrastructure as code

This section will bring together your VM work with git, as you develop a script to automate your activities and commit it to source control.

**Vagrant up from the lab directory**

IMPORTANT: We will NOT vagrant up from your ~/vagrant directory. +
 +
Instead, we will vagrant up from your ~/example directory. A Vagrantfile has been placed there.


....
teststud@serverXXX:~/example$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> default: Importing base box 'opscode-ubuntu-14.04a'...
==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
==> default: Setting the name of the VM: example_default_1424923870330_27416
==> default: Fixed port collision for 22 => 2222. Now on port 2201.
==> default: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
==> default: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
[more]
....

**Script your work**

Go into your VM:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ vagrant ssh
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-23-generic x86_64)
...some stuff
Welcome to your Vagrant-built virtual machine.
Last login: Fri Sep 14 06:23:18 2012 from 10.0.2.2
vagrant@xenial64:~$
....

Go to the /vagrant directory on your Vagrant virtual machine and list the files. (Dont get confused with the /home/vagrant directory.)

....
vagrant@xenial64:~$ cd /vagrant
vagrant@xenial64:/vagrant$ ls
example-Instructions.md  LICENSE  README.md  resources  starter.sh  YourStudentID-testfile.adoc  Vagrantfile
....

If you examine the /vagrant directory, you will realize it has the same contents as your ~/example directory on the class server. In fact, it's the exact same directory! What's going on here? The /vagrant directory in your virtual machine is linked to the ~/example directory on the  host machine (class server). This virtual link provides an easy mechanism to
share and move files between your virtual machine and the host server. You should see your *-testfile.adoc in the /vagrant directory file listing.

Now for the main work of this section:

Starting with starter.sh, write a shell script that automates:

1. the directory creation you did manually in Part 1
2. tree installation
3. git installation

Before beginning this work, let's review the Linux application installation commands:

 apt-get install -y tree
 apt-get install -y git

Here are a couple additional notes to help you create the shell script:

  * Use Nano. Notice the shebang (#!/bin/bash) at the top of starter.sh.

  * Name it YourStudentID-Lab02.sh

  * You will need to change (chmod) the permissions correctly to run it.

Start out by copying the starter.sh script to a new file, and then set the file permissions to allow execution.

 vagrant@xenial64:/vagrant$ cp starter.sh YourStudentID-Lab02.sh
 vagrant@xenial64:/vagrant$ sudo chmod 755 YourStudentID-Lab02.sh

Yes, you can use sudo (administrative privileges) *within your VM.* If you get an error, it means you are likely not in your VM, but back out on the course server.

Remember to substitute your actual ID for "YourStudentID."

....
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ sudo chmod 755 YourStudentID-Lab02.sh
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ ls -l
total 44
-rw-r--r-- 1 vagrant vagrant 14183 Feb 20 15:22 example-Instructions.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 vagrant vagrant  1084 Feb 20 15:22 LICENSE
-rw-r--r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    33 Feb 20 15:22 README.md
drwxr-xr-x 1 vagrant vagrant  4096 Feb 20 15:22 resources
-rw-r--r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   152 Feb 20 15:22 starter.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vagrant vagrant   152 Feb 20 15:58 YourStudentID-Lab02.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 vagrant vagrant    24 Feb 20 15:33 YourStudentID-testfile.adoc
-rw-r--r-- 1 vagrant vagrant   296 Feb 20 15:45 Vagrantfile
....

Run the script to confirm you can execute it (it's still empty, and will run fine - it just won't do anything):

    vagrant@XXXXX:~/vagrant$ ./YourStudentID-Lab02.sh  <- notice the "./"

Create your script by adding the commands to the script file using nano.

    vagrant@XXXXX:~/vagrant$ nano YourStudentID-Lab02.sh

_Add the necessary commands so that the script does what it needs to do!_

Oops, something seems to be wrong when you run it:

....
vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant$ ./YourStudentID-Lab02.sh
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
....

Because the script has commands that initiate software installation in it, you need to run the script as superuser:

....
vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant$ sudo ./YourStudentID-Lab02.sh
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following NEW packages will be installed:

Processing triggers for man-db (2.6.7.1-1ubuntu1) ...

....

After running your script, you will need to confirm that it setup the required directory structure properly. Run the tree command:

 vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant:/vagrant$ tree

Did you see the results you expected? If not, you can issue the command below to remove the directories created by your script. You may need to make changes and execute your script multiple times to perfect it.

 vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant:/vagrant$ rm -rf A C D


You can also remove the tree and git applications to reset your environment completely using these commands:

 vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant:/vagrant$ sudo apt-get remove git
 vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant:/vagrant$ sudo apt-get remove tree


Once you are happy with your script, tell the new git instance *within your VM* your name & email (you have to do this again, because the VM is a whole new environment.)

....
vagrant@xenial64:/vagrant$ git config --global user.email "you@stthomas.edu"
vagrant@xenial64:/vagrant$ git config --global user.name "your name"
....

Then add your new script file to git tracking and commit the file to your local repository:

....
vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant$ git add YourStudentID-Lab02.sh
vagrant@XXXXX:/vagrant$ git commit YourStudentID-Lab02.sh -m "script commit"
[master b5f0950] script commit
 Committer: vagrant <vagrant@xenial64.(none)>
[email error]
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+)
 create mode 100755 YourStudentID-Lab02.sh
....

In reviewing the directory structure, there are duplicate directories. Also, it is getting messy with three directories at the same level.

Fix the directory creation logic so that

1. There are no duplicate C and D directories (you will need to use another letter).
2. All the directories are inside a single directory called "main".

Run the updated script & confirm it works. You should see a tree output like:

....
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ tree

Create a new git commit with your updated script and review the differences with the previous version:

 vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ git commit YourStudentID-Lab02.sh -m "2nd script commit"
 vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ git log -p

*You are now doing "infrastructure as code."* You have automated a complex set of commands, checked them into source control, made significant changes, and checked the commands in again. You can see both versions of your script in the git commit logs.

When you are satisfied, push your local repository back into your Github account (also known as the origin).

....
vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': YourGithubID
Password for 'https://YourGithubID@github.com':

   1c23c80..72958e4  master -> master
....
Note, your script is at risk until you do this because your script only exists on your local hard drive. Pushing your repository up to Github is like making a backup copy of your source files.

Exit the Vagrant instance (now back on the class server prompt) and destroy your Vagrant virtual machine:

    vagrant@vagrant:/vagrant$ exit
	logout
	Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
	YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ vagrant destroy

Notice that your script is still in your ~/example directory. Again, all files in the /vagrant directory on your virtual machine were mapped to the ~/example directory on the host server.

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ cat YourStudentID-Lab02.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Starter shell script
# Rename as YourID-Lab02.sh
# Put commands below
# To run, type ./YourID-Lab02.sh (you need the "./")
# It must have permissions starting with a "7"

mkdir -p main/{A/{B,C,D},E/{F,G},H/{I,J/{K,L},M}}
touch main/{A/{aa,B/bb,C/cc,D/dd},E/{ee,F/ff,G/gg},H/{hh,I/ii,J/{jj,K/kk,L/ll},M/mm}}
apt-get -y install tree
apt-get -y install git
....

**Automate provisioning with Vagrant**

You should now be on the main server (you have destroyed your VM above).

Add and commit your Vagrantfile to source control (see above).

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ git add Vagrantfile
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ git commit -m "Vagrantfile commit"
....

Edit your Vagrantfile so that it calls your *-Lab02.sh script when you provision the machine. Add the "vm.provision" line, changing MyStudentID to your ID.

....
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  config.vm.box = "xenial64"
  config.vm.provision             :shell, path: "./MyStudentID-Lab02.sh"
end
....

Vagrant up your machine and ssh into it, verify that your script has been run. What happened here? Vagrant automatically executed your shell script on the new virtual machine after it started up.

Verify that the following tasks were successfully completed on the virtual machine:

. Directory "main" properly configured in /vagrant
. git installed (run git --version)
. tree installed

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/example$ vagrant ssh

Re-commit your Vagrantfile and push it back to origin.

Finally, issue a pull request for me to review your work.

Discuss:

- Why can you commit to git on the VM without initializing the repo there? You had to at least set up your name and email. Hint: Think about the virtual directory mapping and execute the comand "ls -al" on the /vagrant directory in the VM.
- How are git and tree getting installed, since you don't say "sudo vagrant up"?

That is the end of this lab. Congratulations, this was a lot of work. Next week, we will start working on the the continuous integration pipeline with git, Java, JUnit, Tomcat, and Ant.
