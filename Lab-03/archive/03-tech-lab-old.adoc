= Lab 03 (Technical) The core application practices

== Bringing up the VM

**Overview**

The purpose of this lab is to give you a realistic, if brief overview of (reasonably) modern application development practices.

You will find as an IT professional, even if you are not a software developer, that you need on occasion to "dig in" to the application world and make sense of things from basic tutorials and online resources.

Lab objectives:

In this lab, you will work with basic application tools, as an individual developer. You will see test-driven development in action, in a very simple form, with automated build and deployment to a local Tomcat instance.

You will start by initializing a Vagrant machine that has been preconfigured as a simple developer workstation with:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)[Java]
* http://junit.org/[JUnit]
* http://ant.apache.org/[Ant]
* http://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat]
* https://git-scm.com/[git]

**Prerequisites**

You must have completed lab 2 and issued pull requests for me.

**Clone the Examples repository**

Log into the main server via ssh in the usual way.

Make sure you are in your home directory.

    cd ~

Install the following Vagrant plugin (you do have permissions to do this)

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
Installing the 'vagrant-berkshelf' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
Installed the plugin 'vagrant-berkshelf (4.0.4)'!
Post install message from the 'vagrant-berkshelf' plugin:

The Vagrant Berkshelf plugin requires Berkshelf from the Chef Development Kit.
You can download the latest version of the Chef Development Kit from:

   https://downloads.getchef.com/chef-dk

Installing Berkshelf via other methods is not officially supported.
....

Clone the Calavera project:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$  git clone https://github.com/dm-academy/Calavera.git
Cloning into 'Calavera'...

....
Change to the Calavera directory:

    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ cd Calavera/

Now, you will see a new Vagrantfile. Have a look at it:

    YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ more Vagrantfile

(File is lengthy. More only shows you one screen at a time. You can hit the space bar repeatedly to go through it, or q to exit.)

There are a number of machines defined, such as


....
###############################################################################
###################################    base   #################################
###############################################################################
....

Each section like that defines how Vagrant should bring up a machine and configure it. There are a number of new commands we haven't seen before. Let's focus on the following:

....

###############################################################################
###################################    manos1    ##############################
###############################################################################

  config.vm.define "manos1" do | manos1 |
    manos1.vm.host_name            ="manos1.calavera.biz"
    manos1.vm.network              "private_network", ip: "10.1.0.14"
    manos1.vm.network              "forwarded_port", guest: 22, host: 2114, auto_correct: true

    manos1.vm.network              "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 9114, auto_correct: true

    manos1.ssh.forward_agent        =true

    manos1.vm.synced_folder        "./shared", "/mnt/shared"
    #manos1.vm.provision         :shell, path: "./shell/manos1.sh"

    manos1.vm.provision :chef_zero do |chef|
      chef.cookbooks_path         = ["./cookbooks/"]
      chef.data_bags_path           = ["./data_bags/"]
      chef.nodes_path               = ["./nodes/"]
      chef.roles_path               = ["./roles/"]
      chef.add_recipe               "shared::_apt-update"
      chef.add_recipe               "git::default"
      chef.add_recipe               "localAnt::default"
      chef.add_recipe               "java7::default"   #   this is redundant. we already installed this in base and tomcat also installs Java. but won't work w/o it.
      chef.add_recipe               "localTomcat::v8"
      chef.add_recipe               "shared::_junit"
      chef.add_recipe               "manos::default"
      if ENV['LAB_NUM']=="lab03"
        puts "Skipping remote git"
      else
        chef.add_recipe               "manos::git-remote.rb"
      end
    end
  end
....

You used a shell provisioner in your previous lab to apply your script to your new VM. But what's this? This line in the example above

 #manos1.vm.provision         :shell, path: "./shell/manos1.sh"

is commented out (the # means that Vagrant won't execute that line).

Rather than using a shell provisioner to install software on our VM, we are starting to use Chef. As mentioned in the  http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_policy_based_approaches[readings for Session 02], Chef is a configuration management system.

Now, http://searchaws.techtarget.com/definition/Opscode-Chef[read a bit about Chef] and https://docs.chef.io/chef_quick_overview.html[a bit more] before you continue.

A full treatment of Chef is beyond the scope of this class. However, you should understand a few things. You should still be in your Calavera directory. Run the tree command:

....

The ".rb" extension indicates the Ruby language, which is used to develop Chef scripts.

TIP: If you are using Putty or some other terminal emulator and getting garbage characters like âââ in your tree, see http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/61293/how-can-i-change-locale-encoding-to-avoid-getting-weird-characters-in-terminal[here].

This directory structure is the entire Calavera project, which is a simple DevOps simulation that all runs through Vagrant.

Examine the Vagrantfile again (use `cat` or `more`), and notice in the Vagrantfile the directives:

    manos.vm.provision :chef_zero do |chef|

The above tells Vagrant to use Chef to set up the virtual machine.

    chef.cookbooks_path = ["./cookbooks/"]

The above tells Chef where the cookbooks are.

....
chef.add_recipe               "shared::_apt-update"
chef.add_recipe               "git::default"
chef.add_recipe               "localAnt::default"
chef.add_recipe               "java7::default"
chef.add_recipe               "localTomcat::v8"
chef.add_recipe               "shared::_junit"
chef.add_recipe               "manos::default"

....

Finally, the above tells Chef to apply a series of recipes from various parts of the tree. These recipes install software and configure the system in various ways.

*Have a look at some of them.*  Use "cat."

  YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ cat cookbooks/localAnt/recipes/default.rb

The combination of these recipes precisely describes what the virtual machine will look like. If you delete a VM and bring it back up, it should look exactly the same every time.

Now, the current Vagrantfile is a little dangerous, because if you type "vagrant up" it will try to bring up ALL of the machines. So, I have created a shell script you should use.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT ISSUE A `vagrant up` COMMAND IN THIS LAB.

Return to the Calavera base directory and issue the following command, to bring the necessary image into your environment:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ cd ~/Calavera/
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ vagrant box add opscode-ubuntu-14.04a /var/vagrant/boxes/opscode-ubuntu-14.04a.box -f

default configuration
Launching from linux/mac
==> box: Box file was not detected as metadata. Adding it directly...
==> box: Adding box 'opscode-ubuntu-14.04a' (v0) for provider:
    box: Unpacking necessary files from: file:///var/vagrant/boxes/opscode-ubuntu-14.04a.box
==> box: Successfully added box 'opscode-ubuntu-14.04a' (v0) for 'virtualbox'!
....

Now, launch your machine through executing the script:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ ./lab-03.sh
Lab 03 manos configuration
Launching from linux/mac
Skipping remote git
Bringing machine 'manos1' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    manos1: The Berkshelf shelf is at "/home/char/.berkshelf/vagrant-berkshelf/shelves/berkshelf20160925-23989-fdanrr-manos1"
==> manos1: Sharing cookbooks with VM
==> manos1: Importing base box 'opscode-ubuntu-14.04a'...
==> manos1: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
    [more]
....

It will take several minutes to launch the new Vagrant instance. In the meantime, YOU NEED TO WATCH THE OUTPUT.

Look for the language "Fixed port collision" in a series like this. THE NUMBERS WILL BE DIFFERENT:

....
==> manos: Fixed port collision for 22 => 2114. Now on port 2201.
==> manos: Fixed port collision for 80 => 8114. Now on port 2202.
==> manos: Fixed port collision for 8080 => 9114. Now on port 2203.
==> manos: Fixed port collision for 22 => 2222. Now on port 2214.
==> manos: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
==> manos: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
    manos: Adapter 1: nat
==> manos: Forwarding ports...
    manos: 22 => 2201 (adapter 1)
    manos: 80 => 2202 (adapter 1)
    manos: 8080 => 2203 (adapter 1)
    manos: 22 => 2214 (adapter 1)
==> manos: Booting VM...
....

MAKE NOTE OF THE PORT 8080 MAPPING. In the above, it says "Now on port 2203." You will have a DIFFERENT number. Write it down.

****
ONLY *if you miss your port*, or can't find it, you will need to do:

 YourStudentID@serverXXX:vboxmanage list vms

You should see output including something like:

 "Calavera_manos_XXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXXX" {389dab0f-2f52-434e-bf50-c9792c42416a}

Go:

 YourStudentID@serverXXX:vboxmanage showvminfo Calavera_manos_XXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXXX|grep 8080

You replace the machine name and the X's with the actual numbers, you should cut and paste

You should see something like this line:

....
NIC 1 Rule(3):   name = tcp8134, protocol = tcp, host ip = , host port = XXXX, guest ip = , guest port = 8080
....

Copy down the "XXXX." It is your port 8080 mapping.
****

Once you have your port 8080 mapping and the Vagrant launching process is complete, you can access your VM's web server. Manos comes preconfigured with a running Tomcat instance and a simple test-harness based Java application. You can see it running when you ssh into the VM:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ vagrant ssh manos1
Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-24-generic x86_64)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
Last login: Sat Feb 21 22:03:53 2015 from 10.0.2.2
....

Next, run the curl command pointing at the running web application:
....
vagrant@manos:~$ curl localhost:8080/MainServlet
<h1>This is a skeleton application-- to explore the end to end Calavera delivery framework.</h1>
....
What is "curl"? curl is like a web browser for the command line.
For more read @ http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html

You can also see the same thing from OUTSIDE your virtual machine. *NOTE: 'XXXX' _must be replaced_ with the port mapping you captured above.*

....
vagrant@manos:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
test4@seis660:~/Calavera$ curl 127.0.0.1:XXXX/MainServlet
<h1>This is a skeleton application-- to explore the end to end Calavera delivery framework.</h1>
....

Finally, you can view it in a real browser over X windows.

NOTE: You may not find much use for X-windows in the outside world, but it is helpful here as it prevents us from worrying about hardening the local Vagrant VMs.

First, be sure you logged into the server with X enabled. You need to either:

* Check the box in Putty // For people using xming 6.9 above, there will be enable x11 forwarding checkbox under ssh.
* go "ssh -X YourStudentID@serverXXX" if you are using your Mac console (or have Linux on your machine)

NOTE: You do *not* need Firefox on your local laptop for this to work. You *do* need to have X11 forwarding working, with a local Xwindows display. For example, if XMing is installed, open XLaunch and click through the screens with the defaults. See also https://github.com/dm-academy/aitm-labs/blob/master/Lab-00/00-tech-lab.adoc[Lab 00], Configuring X-Windows.

Type "xclock" for a quick test. See https://github.com/dm-academy/aitm-labs/blob/master/Lab-00/00-tech-lab.adoc[Configuring X-Windows] in Lab 00.

At the command line, go:
....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~$ firefox -no-remote "127.0.0.1:PORT/MainServlet"

(process:46597): GLib-CRITICAL **: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed
Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"
....

It will throw a lot of errors, ignore them. You should (slowly) get a Firefox browser painted on your screen. This is X-windows in action, Firefox is actually running on the server.

image::browser2.png[]

You can either close Firefox or hit Command-C to exit.

Exit your VM.

== A look at the application

Let's look at what goes into making this little app work. First, how did it get there? If you are still in your VM, exit from the VM back to the classroom server. Be sure you are in the Calavera directory.

You can see the resources used by the application if you go:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ tree cookbooks/manos/
cookbooks/manos/
├── files
│   ├── build.xml
│   ├── Class1.java
│   ├── INTERNAL_gitignore
│   ├── MainServlet.java
│   ├── TestClass1.java
│   └── web.xml
├── metadata.rb
└── recipes
    └── default.rb
....

Now, the cookbook here includes the raw ingredients (the contents of the cookbooks/manos/files directory) as well as the recipes of how to set them up on the VM. Especially, have a look at cookbooks/manos/recipes/default.rb:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ more  cookbooks/manos/recipes/default.rb
# manos-default

# set up developer workstation

# assuming Chef has set up Java, Tomcat, ant and junit
# need to establish directory structure
# move source code over

package "tree"

group 'git'

user 'vagrant' do
  group 'git'
end

["/home/hijo/src/main/config",
 "/home/hijo/src/main/java/biz/calavera",
 "/home/hijo/src/test/java/biz/calavera",
 "/home/hijo/target/biz/calavera"].each do | name |

  directory name  do
    mode 00775
    action :create
    user "vagrant"
    group "git"
    recursive true
  end
end

file_map = {
  "INTERNAL_gitignore" => "/home/hijo/.gitignore",
 "build.xml" => "/home/hijo/build.xml",
 "web.xml" => "/home/hijo/src/main/config/web.xml",
 "Class1.java" => "/home/hijo/src/main/java/biz/calavera/Class1.java",
 "MainServlet.java" =>  "/home/hijo/src/main/java/biz/calavera/MainServlet.java",
 "TestClass1.java" => "/home/hijo/src/test/java/biz/calavera/TestClass1.java"
}

# download each file and place it in right directory
file_map.each do | fileName, pathName |
  cookbook_file fileName do
    path pathName
    user "vagrant"
    group "git"
    action :create
  end
end

...
....

There is more, but you get the idea. Without going into the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)[Ruby] code this is written in (which would be too much detail for this class), this script  is creating a set of directory structures on the new manos VM and populating them with the basic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)[Java] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant[Ant] files needed. For example, this command:

    "build.xml" => "/home/hijo/build.xml"

says,

. take the file called `build.xml` from the source files on the host, and
. copy it into `/home/hijo/build.xml` on the guest.

Go back into your manos VM and have a look at the home/hijo directory:

....
YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ vagrant ssh manos1
Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-24-generic x86_64)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
Last login: Sun Feb 22 18:29:29 2015 from 10.0.2.2
....

Now run the tree command:

....
vagrant@manos:~$ tree /home/hijo
/home/hijo
├── build.xml
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── config
│   │   │   └── web.xml

    │       └── TestClass1.class
    ├── CalaveraMain.jar
    ├── result.txt
    ├── result.xml
    └── web.xml

....

That configured directory tree is the outcome of the Chef scripts that were applied when the first Vagrant up was done.

Without going deeply into object-oriented programming, this application has three major parts:

. A main class that controls everything (`MainServlet.java`).
. A class called `Class1.java` that does 2 things:
.. Returns a string "five" when you call the `.five` method on the class
.. Wraps any string with the tags <H1> and </H1>, turning it into an HTML heading 1 string.
. A test class, `TestClass1.java`, that tests `Class1.java` (but not `MainServlet.java`, just because that gets complicated for a simple exercise like this).

But wait, there is more. How is Tomcat actually serving up the servlet?

Run tree:

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ tree /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/
/var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/
├── lib
│   └── CalaveraMain.jar
└── web.xml

1 directory, 2 files
....

In order for the `CalaveraMain.jar` file to be served up, it needs to be put in the `WEB-INF/lib` directory that Tomcat knows about, and the `web.xml` file needs to be updated as well. How did this happen?

And as a matter of fact, where did that `CalaveraMain.jar` file come from, anyways? It wasn't part of the files stored in the cookbook...!? Go back and look.

This is where the magic of Ant comes in. `CalaveraMain.jar` is a **compiled and packaged** version of the java classes you see in the `java/biz/calavera` directory.

Back when Java first came out, the developer would have to painstakingly compile and package the software by hand, move it manually to the Tomcat directory, and restart Tomcat. But with Ant (and similar tools like https://maven.apache.org/[Maven]), we can do this all automatically. Go:

....
vagrant@manos:~$ cd /home/hijo/
vagrant@manos1:/home/hijo$ sudo ant

== Ant exercises

You can see the Ant script at build.xml. Compare that script to the output. It is:

- Running the junit tests (more on that later)
- Compiling the java *.java files into *.class files
- Packaging the *.java files into a *.jar file
- Moving the jar file to the appropriate Tomcat directory, along with the web.xml configuration file
- Restarting Tomcat

Ant documentation is at http://ant.apache.org/.

Review build.xml in detail  with reference to the Ant documentation and answer the following questions:

. What lines in the file tell the build process where the source code files are?
. What lines in the file tell the build process where to put the compiled file?
. What lines in the file tell the build process to restart Tomcat?

Using nano, change line 29 from :

 <pathelement location="/var/lib/tomcat8/lib/servlet-api.jar"/>

to

 <pathelement location="/var/libx/tomcat8/lib/servlet-api.jar"/>

Run `sudo ant` again. Google the error result. What is the problem?

Examine web.xml. This is a critical file. What do you notice about it, compared to the tree command from /home/hijo?

Fix what you need to fix. 

== Changing the application

Let's play with the Java a little bit. Start by editing the MainServlet.java file:

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ nano src/main/java/biz/calavera/MainServlet.java

  GNU nano 2.2.6                      File: src/main/java/biz/calavera/MainServlet.java                                                            Modified

package biz.calavera;

//package test;

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

public class MainServlet extends HttpServlet {
        // Import required java libraries

          private String message;

          public void init() throws ServletException
          {
              // Edit this message, save the file, and rebuild with Ant
              // to see it reflected on the Web page at http://localhost:8081/MainServlet
              message = "This is a skeleton application-- to explore the end to end Calavera delivery framework.";
          }

          public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
                            HttpServletResponse response)
                    throws ServletException, IOException
          {
              // Set response content type
              response.setContentType("text/html");

              // Actual logic goes here.
              PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
              Class1 oResp = new Class1(message);

              out.println(oResp.webMessage());
          }

          public void destroy()
          {
              // do nothing.
          }
        }
....

Find the line that says:

    message = "This is a skeleton application-- to explore the end to end Calavera delivery framework."

and change it to

    message = "YourStudentID This is a skeleton application-- to explore the end to end Calavera delivery framework."

Exit nano and run Ant again:

    vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ sudo ant
    [ same output as before ]

Now try:

    vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ curl localhost:8080/MainServlet
    <h1>YourStudentID This is a skeleton application-- to explore the end to end Calavera delivery framework.</h1>

If you did it correctly, you should see that Tomcat (via curl) is now serving up the change you made. Many automated steps were executed between you making that change and it appearing in curl!

NOTE: If you want to see this in firefox, just open a *new* ssh session to SEIS660 with X enabled and don't go into your VM. Remember to use your specific mapped 8080 port number that Vagrant setup.

Let's add it to git:
....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ git add src/main/java/biz/calavera/MainServlet.java
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ git commit -m "my local java"
[master 04ff3cb] my local java
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
....
NOTE: Git is installed, with a repo initialized already in /home/hijo. If this were a completely new system, you would need to install git and init the repo.

Review your change:

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ git log -p -1

Hit `q` to get out of the git review.

Now, let's break something.

Review the test class:

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ more src/test/java/biz/calavera/TestClass1.java
package biz.calavera;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import org.junit.After;
import org.junit.AfterClass;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.BeforeClass;
import org.junit.Test;

public class TestClass1 {

	private Class1 a;

	@BeforeClass
	public static void setUpBeforeClass() throws Exception {
	}

	@AfterClass
	public static void tearDownAfterClass() throws Exception {
	}

	@Before
	public void setUp() throws Exception {
		 this.a = new Class1("TestWebMessage");
	}

	@After
	public void tearDown() throws Exception {
	}

	@Test
	public void testTrue() {
                    assertTrue("assertTrue test", true);  // true is true
                    assertNotNull("a is not null", this.a); //a exists
                    assertEquals("five is 5", "five", this.a.five());  //a.five = "five"
                    assertEquals("string correctly generated", "<h1>TestWebMessage</h1>", this.a.webMessag
e());  // string built correctly
	}

}
....

Edit the Class1.java file:

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ nano src/main/java/biz/calavera/Class1.java

  GNU nano 2.2.6                                 File: src/main/java/biz/calavera/Class1.java

package biz.calavera;


public class Class1 {
          String strMsg;

          public Class1 (String inString)
          {
                    strMsg = inString;
          }
        public String five()
        {
                return "five";
        }

          public String webMessage()
          {
              return "<h1>" + strMsg + "</h1>";
          }


        }
....


Replace

    return "five";

with

    return "four";

Rebuild with ant:

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ sudo ant
Buildfile: /home/hijo/build.xml

init:
     [echo]
     [echo] 			Computer name is ${my_env.COMPUTERNAME}
     [echo]                         User name is root
     [echo] 			Building from /home/hijo/build.xml
     [echo] 			Java is version 1.7
     [echo] 			Project is ${ant.project.name}
     [echo] 			Ant is Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.4 compiled on April 29 2014
     [echo] 			Basedir is /home/hijo

     [echo] 			Build target is ./target
     [echo] 			Deployment target is /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib
     [echo]

compile:
    [javac] Compiling 2 source files to /home/hijo/target
    [javac] Compiling 1 source file to /home/hijo/target

test:
     [echo]
     [echo] 			entering test
     [echo]

BUILD FAILED
/home/hijo/build.xml:69: Test biz.calavera.TestClass1 failed

Total time: 1 second
....

We got something quite different - a failed build.


We can see the results this way:

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ cat target/result.txt
Testsuite: biz.calavera.TestClass1
Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.074 sec

junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: five is 5 expected:<f[ive]> but was:<f[our]>
	at biz.calavera.TestClass1.testTrue(Unknown Source)
....

Notice we can still curl. The broken build was not deployed to the local Tomcat.

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ curl localhost:8080/MainServlet
<h1>YourStudentID This is a skeleton application-- to explore the end to end Calavera delivery framework.</h1>
....


Why did this happen? Go back to the test harness and notice the line:

 assertEquals("five is 5", "five", this.a.five());  //a.five = "five"

NOTE: The `//` in the line above indicates a comment in the Java test.

What this says is there is a method (a command or instruction) on TestClass1 called "five," and in fact if it is called it should (unsurprisingly) return EXACTLY the string "`five`". No more, no less.

In terms of the JUnit test language, the test ASSERTS that the method `five` invoked on the object `this.a` (which was constructed out of Class1, as you can see at the start of the test class), will be EQUAL to "five." We purposefully broke the test by telling the method to return "four".

Test driven development is a critically important part of building applications and you are encouraged to deepen your familiarity with it. This is the simplest, most basic discussion imaginable.

Let's abandon the changes that "broke the build":

    vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ git reset --hard

This command discards all changes you have not committed.

Do

    cat src/main/java/biz/calavera/Class1.java

and you will see "four" reverted to "five."

Finally, let's go back to the original version without YourStudentID in the message:

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ git log --pretty=short --abbrev-commit
commit 3b810e4
Author: Charles Betz <char@calavera.biz>

    my local java

commit b45dc90
Author: Charles Betz <char@calavera.biz>

    initial commit
....

Notice in the above the line:

 commit 3b810e4

The string `3b810e4` is the commit hash. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics[More on Git hashing & other topics.]

Find the git commit hash associated with your commit by running `git log --pretty=short --abbrev-commit` as in the example above. Then, run the revert command:

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ git revert <hash>
....

NOTE: You will need to edit the revert message in nano. Save and exit.

....
[master b66c1c9] Revert "my local java"
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
....

See that "YourStudentID" is now removed, as we have reverted to the original version of the code.

....
vagrant@manos:/home/hijo$ cat src/main/java/biz/calavera/MainServlet.java
....

Rebuild with ant and check that the original functionality is restored. Use Curl again.


Exit your VM and destroy it:

 vagrant@manos:exit
 YourStudentID@serverXXX:~/Calavera$ vagrant destroy manos1 -f

== Extra credit

Suppose the system fails to build correctly (as a new manos1 instance) and you identify that Class1.java is missing on the newly created machine. Suggest at least two reasons why that might happen and where the issue could be. Identify specific locations in the Chef resources (directories and file contents) that could be the problem. (10 points)


Congratulations, you have finished another lab. Next up: an end to end DevOps pipeline.
